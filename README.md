# IMD-Internship-Homework

## Instructions

1. Share to [me](https://github.com/sid410) your github username or email so that I can add you as collaborator to [this repository](https://github.com/sid410/IMD-Internship-Homework.git).

2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/sid410/IMD-Internship-Homework.git).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sid410/IMD-Internship-Homework.git
```

3. Based from main, create a new branch called `spring-2025/lastname` (*Change the lastname to your actual lastname in smallcaps).

```bash
git checkout -b spring-2025/lastname
```

4. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs) to learn OpenCV:
    - The actual code of the tutorial is actually available [here](https://github.com/murtazahassan/Learn-OpenCV-in-3-hours), however to really internalize your learning please do not cheat. Follow the tutorial step by step, writing the code yourself.
    - For the installation, following the tutorial with PyCharm is ok, but you can also use other methods, for example I use VS Code with Python 3.11.3 (depends on your preference). I would also recommend using `venv` when doing python projects in your machine.
    - For the 9 chapters, place the `py` files under Tutorial folder (i.e. `Tutorial/chapter1.py`).
    - To show that you have successfully implemented each chapter tutorial, please take a screenshot or gif of the end result for each chapter and place them under Tutorial/Proof folder.

5. Understand the 3 Projects in the tutorial and make your own:
   - Please create a new py file in the Project folder (not the Tutorial folder). You can create as many py files or other related code inside this Project folder.
   - Think of an interesting computer vision project you really want to do (should be different from the 3 example projects shown in tutorial). Depending on your interest, it could be just as simple as image processing using the standard OpenCV library, or using more advance DNNs like [YOLO](https://github.com/autogyro/yolo-V8) for object detection and segmentation.
   - For those who really want challenge, you can try to make more advanced computer vision projects like using Mediapipe and TensorFlow. One interesting project is this Naruto handseal recognition project: [code](https://github.com/ben-tiki/naruto-handseal-recognition) / [demo](https://ben-tiki.github.io/naruto-handseal-recognition/)
   - But do keep in mind that you only have four days to complete the tutorial + project.

6. Do not forget to publish your branch to this repository and push your changes (DO NOT merge to main).

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin spring-2025/lastname
```

### That's all, have fun! 楽しんでね～
